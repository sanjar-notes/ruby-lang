# 1. Motivation
Created Tuesday 14 December 2021

#### Situation

* I am working at Vimeo. Specifically the OTT (Over the Top team, erstwhile VHX).
* The front-end is build using React.js, back-end is build using Ruby on Rails.
* Objectives (work) is feature based irrespective of backend/front-end.
* So I have to be a full-stack developer, and learn Ruby.
* One of my "buddies" (help), a Senior Engineer, Anil, guided me throught two websites to learn Ruby.
* I've completed them as of now.
* What remains is a thorough writing down of my understanding.
* My understanding is scattered in various files I made while doing a book Anil suggested.
* I can use this as a starting point in writing down this notebook.


#### Thought

* Many top companies use Ruby, so it's performant.
* I have no coding exposure to back-end, and this will give me experience designing and coding the backend.
* I can abstract out Ruby, Rails and see backend development in a language/framework agnostic manner.
* So I am OK with learning Ruby (it's demand/use is decreasing, funfact: pay is higher).


#### Action

1. Use Ruby files I've made as a starting point.
2. Read books on Ruby and polish my understanding.
