# 1. My Ruby files
Created Tuesday 14 December 2021


* [This](./1._My_Ruby_files/ruby_hard_way) folder has Ruby files that I made while going through the book '[Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)'.
* Other resources I used here:
	* I've also used [Codecademy's Ruby Cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby/modules/learn-ruby-introduction-to-ruby-u/cheatsheet) to add material here.
	* Very short [intro](https://www.rubyguides.com/ruby-tutorial/) to Ruby.
